# SINION

## Welcome to Sinion, it's a twitter-based web forum with threading and commenting systems for everyone.

## It was built using mainly javascript and nodejs, but EJS, HTML, CSS technologies were also used in it. In its database, Google's Firebase was used.

Also remembering that SINION is not yet complete, there is still a lot of work ahead.

Sinion is unfortunately not live yet. But you can use it very easily. Just follow the instructions below:
  1-) Download the project on your machine
2-) Open the terminal and use the command: `node index`
3-) Now Sinion will be running on port 8080. Just go to your browser and type "localhost:8080" or "yourIP:8080"
